# chatbot-eliza

### About

This is an implementation of a chatbot inspired by Eliza. I built this because I wanted to study the algorithms of Eliza and learn about how this language model works. I used Java and object-oriented programming techniques.Â You can find more information about Eliza below.


ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966[1] at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum. Created to demonstrate the superficiality of communication between man and machine, Eliza simulated conversation by using a 'pattern matching' and substitution methodology that gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program, but had no built in framework for contextualizing events. The most famous script, DOCTOR, simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist and used rules, dictated in the script, to respond with non-directional questions to user inputs. As such, ELIZA was one of the first chatterbots, but was also regarded as one of the first programs capable of passing the Turing Test. (Taken from [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA))
